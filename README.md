# chainshot-blockchain-explorer

This is a week-end project part of the Chainshot Ethereum Dev bootcamp.
Working on this I gained better understanding of JSON-RPC, web3 Providers and querying Ethereum Nodes.

### How to run:

Add your web3 provider URL (Alchemy/Infura) to .env

In the main directory, run "npm i" followed by "npm start" in order to run the project.
